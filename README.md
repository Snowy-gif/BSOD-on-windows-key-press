# BSOD-on-windows-key-press
This app was made using python. It was made with a lot of modules such as keyboard to help make this happen. It works where it looks at each key on the keyboard you are pressing and if it sees you press the windows key it activates a script that will gain privileges and will tell the CPU that a fatal error had happened and it will activate a BSOD. 
Please download the zip file and go into the dist folder, and run the .EXE from there. Downloading the .EXE as a standalone will not work.
